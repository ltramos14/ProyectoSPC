### Breaking Changes

We switched from ngx-take-until-destroy to ngneat/until-destroy (the successor of the first library available for Angular 10+) and there are adjustments needed. There's an easy migration script:
1. `cd src` (into your /src folder in the vex-angular folder)
2. run `npx @ngneat/until-destroy --removeOnDestroy`

A few occurences could still appear, because the automated script can't pick them up. Here's a step-by-step on how to manually adjust the entries:

Replace:
`import { untilDestroyed } from 'ngx-take-until-destroy';`

With:
`import { UntilDestroy, untilDestroyed } from '@ngneat/until-destroy';`

and add `@UntilDestroy()` above your `@Component()` or `@Injectable()`

Example:

```typescript
@UntilDestroy()
@Injectable()
export class TestService {
    test() {
        test$.pipe(
            untilDestroyed(this)
        ).subscribe(value => doStuff(value));
    }   
}
```

This library and structure is needed so any subscriptions we create get automatically cleaned up (unsubscribed) when the component/service gets destroyed by Angular.
